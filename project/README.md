Get started learning Attune **fast**.

Attune is very simple SysOps automation and orchestration tool. Attune 
enables you to build automated processes with the popular scripting 
languages that you're already familiar with such as bash and PowerShell.

This project will show you how to **Create and Run** a `Hello World!` 
process for both bash for Linux and PowerShell for Windows.

This won't take long, have fun!
