Creating a bash task to display `Hello, World!` is simple.

# Connecting Attune to a Device

Attune connects to Linux devices using ssh. The Secure Shell (SSH), 
also known as Secure Socket Shell, is a protocol that enables 
secure connections to remote computers or servers through a text-based 
interface.

Once a secure SSH connection is established, a shell session is 
initiated, allowing you to interact with the server by entering 
commands within the client on your local computer.

SSH is primarily used by system and network administrators, as 
well as individuals who require a highly secure method of remotely 
managing computers.

# Is SSH is Enabled on the Device

To establish an SSH connection, it is necessary to have both a client 
and a server component installed on the local and remote machines, 
respectively. A commonly utilised open source SSH tool for Linux 
distributions is OpenSSH. Installing OpenSSH is a straightforward 
process that requires access to the terminal on both the server and 
the connecting computer. It's important to note that Ubuntu does not 
have an SSH server pre-installed by default.
